# Garfield_Lasagna_Cat_The_Pipe_Strip_07-27-1978_Auto_Typer
This uses a python script to automatically type [**THE ENTIRE SCRIPT FOR LASAGNA CAT'S MASTERPIECE: 07/27/1978**](https://youtu.be/NAh9oLs67Cw?t=73).

Seriously, the whole thing.

It simulates typing so that services that read 'now typing...' will make others think you're unhinged, and are typing the entire thing.

Before running, make sure you have python installed: open command prompt and type `python --version`.
If you have it installed, you'll get a version number.  If not, install it.

Download / pull this repository somewhere in your computer. 

Pull up whever you want the typing to happen in/on.

Navigate to where you installed this on your command prompt / terminal.

Initiate with `python3 auto_typing_garfield.py`

Click on the text / input field of wherever you want this to type, and just let it run for a few hours.
