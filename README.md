Perfect for confusing coworkers in Slack, freaking out your Discord friends, or showing unwavering dedication to postmodern Garfield fan art.

## üíª Requirements

* **Python 3** - We need this programming language to run the script
* **Git** (optional) - For downloading the code easily

## üì¶ Setup & Usage (Windows Newbie Guide)

### Step 1: Install Python

1. **Check if Python is already installed**:
   - Press `Windows Key + R` to open the Run dialog
   - Type `cmd` and press Enter to open Command Prompt
   - Type `python --version` and press Enter
   - If you see something like "Python 3.11.0", you're good! Skip to Step 2.
   - If you get an error, continue below.

2. **Download and install Python**:
   - Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Click the big yellow "Download Python" button
   - Run the downloaded file (usually in your Downloads folder)
   - **IMPORTANT**: Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation
   - Click "Install Now" and wait for it to finish

### Step 2: Download the Script

**Option A: Easy way (if you have Git)**
1. Open Command Prompt (Windows Key + R, type `cmd`, press Enter)
2. Navigate to where you want the files (like your Desktop):
   ```cmd
   cd Desktop
   ```
3. Download the repository:
   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Garfield_Lasagna_Cat_The_Pipe_Strip_07-27-1978_Auto_Typer.git
   cd Garfield_Lasagna_Cat_The_Pipe_Strip_07-27-1978_Auto_Typer
   ```

**Option B: Super easy way (no Git needed)**
1. Click the green "Code" button on this GitHub page
2. Click "Download ZIP"
3. Find the ZIP file in your Downloads folder
4. Right-click it and choose "Extract All"
5. Choose where to extract it (like your Desktop)
6. Open the extracted folder

### Step 3: Install Dependencies (if needed)

1. **Open Command Prompt in the script folder**:
   - Navigate to the folder where you downloaded/extracted the script
   - Hold `Shift` and right-click in an empty area of the folder
   - Choose "Open PowerShell window here" or "Open command window here"

2. **Install requirements** (if there's a requirements.txt file):
   ```cmd
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Step 4: Prepare Your Target

1. **Open the app where you want the typing to happen**:
   - Discord, Slack, Notepad, Word document, etc.
   - Click in the text box where you want the typing to appear
   - Leave this window open and visible

### Step 5: Run the Script

1. **In your Command Prompt/PowerShell window** (from Step 3), type:
   ```cmd
   python auto_typing_garfield.py
   ```
   *Note: If that doesn't work, try `python3 auto_typing_garfield.py`*

2. **IMMEDIATELY after pressing Enter**:
   - Quickly click into your target text field (Discord chat, etc.)
   - Don't touch your keyboard or mouse after this
   - The script will start typing automatically

3. **Sit back and watch the chaos unfold** over the next few hours

### Troubleshooting for Windows Users

**"python is not recognized as an internal or external command"**
- Python wasn't added to your PATH during installation
- Reinstall Python and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"

**Script stops or acts weird**
- Don't use your mouse or keyboard while it's running
- Make sure the text field is still selected/active
- Try running as Administrator (right-click Command Prompt ‚Üí "Run as Administrator")

**Want to stop the script?**
- Go back to your Command Prompt window
- Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the script

## üß† Pro Tips for Windows Users

* **Stop the script anytime**: Press `Ctrl+C` in the Command Prompt window
* **Works best in apps that show typing indicators**: Discord, Slack, Teams, etc.
* **Don't touch anything while it's running**: The script controls your keyboard
* **Test it first**: Try it in Notepad before using it in important chats
* **Run in a safe environment**: Consider using a separate user account or virtual machine
* **Keep the Command Prompt window visible**: So you can stop it if needed
* **Make sure Windows doesn't go to sleep**: Go to Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Power & Battery and set sleep to "Never" while running
